Adaptive,Collective responses to a local stimuli.
**Description:**
     As an application, we show how this Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm on reconfigurable graphs can be used to solve the foraging problem, where food sources may be discovered, removed, or shifted at arbitrary times. We would like the agents to consistently self-organize using only local interactions, such that if the food remains in position long enough, the agents transition to a gather phase, collectively forming a single large component with small perimeter around the food. Alternatively, if no food source has existed recently, the agents should self-induce a switch to a search phase in which they distribute themselves randomly throughout the lattice region to search for food. Unlike previous approaches to foraging, this process is indefinitely repeatable. Like a physical phase change, microscopic changes such as the deletion or addition of a single food source triggers these macroscopic, system-wide transitions as agents share information about the environment and respond locally to get the desired collective response.
